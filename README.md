# WeatherApp

in this project i used:
tkinter- as the GUI library.
Matplotlib- for the visualization utility (only for the graph part).
WeatherAPI- api for all the data i needed. 

The main idea is basic, 
ask from the user to enter a location and connect the input to the API (in this API the user can be type  city name or the country name, it'll work either way).
